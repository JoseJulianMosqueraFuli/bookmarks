# Bookmarks

This repository contains the code for a bookmarking application. In this chapter, we focused on building an authentication system for the site. Here are the key features implemented:

- User registration: Users can create an account by providing their username, email, and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- User logout: Users can securely log out of their accounts.
- Password management: Users can change their passwords and reset them if they forget.
- Custom user profiles: A model is implemented to store additional information about each user, such as their date of birth and profile photo.
- Custom authentication backend: An authentication backend is added to allow users to log in using their email address instead of their username.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we will explore the implementation of social authentication using Python Social Auth. This will enable users to authenticate with their Google, Facebook, or Twitter accounts.

Additionally, we will cover serving the development server over HTTPS using Django Extensions. This ensures secure communication between the user's browser and the server.

Lastly, we will customize the authentication pipeline to automatically create user profiles upon registration.

Stay tuned for the upcoming chapter to learn more about these exciting features and how to integrate them into your bookmarking application!
